# odin-landing-page

This is a landing page project according to the specifications [here]
(https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-landing-page). It's made mostly with
flexbox properties. In my opinion, it's a good project to really get your feet wet with
flexbox.

## Some problems
- It might be my browser, but in the quote section, font-weight: 300/light/lighter doesn't show
up, and neither does the correct font color.
- I may not have given landing page enough vertical space, at least when compared to the
correct example. This is seen in the vertical space that the separate sections have, and
how little top + bottom padding they seem to have.
- Section 1 with the placeholder image might be too small. Again, a result of not giving
the page enough vertical space. Some possible fixes: a) increasing the hardcoded vh for
the body, and b) removing vh and manually giving each section a pixel/letting each section 
grow organically
